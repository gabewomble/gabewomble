This is my current (wip) personal site. It was scaffolded using a Sanity.io / Sapper template. I was initially going to set up a sapper integration with a CMS myself, however I've heard good things about Sanity, and it already offers a Sapper template.

## Core Tech

- [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)
- [Sanity.io CMS](https://www.sanity.io)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

## Running the project

1. `npm install` in the project root folder on local
2. `npm run dev` to start the studio and frontend locally
   - CMS will run on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)
   - Client will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. `npm run build` to build to production locally

## Deploy changes

Changes are automatically deployed when pushed to master.
